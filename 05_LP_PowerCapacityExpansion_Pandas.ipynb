We also show how to create this model with Python using gurobipy with an academic license.\n","\n","Next, we discuss the impact of variable renewable energy sources (wind, solar) and present a slightly modified formulation that co-optimizes thermal and renewable capacities.\n","\n","Finally, we will note how this problem generalizes to a \"brownfield\" expansion problem including existing generators, with optimal retirement decisions included in the problem.\n","\n","Note these capacity expansion problems will be basic/simplified formulations, ignoring inter-temporal operating constraints (e.g. ramp limits), energy storage, network constraints and geospatial tradeoffs, unit commitment decisions for thermal generators, and operating reserves.\n","\n","## 1. Optimal thermal generator expansion problem\n","\n","Assume a utility can build any of the following four thermal generation types: geothermal, coal, natural gas combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), and natural gas combustion turbine (CT). The utility must decide on the mix of thermal generators to meet forecasted demand in a future planning year across each hour of the year.\n","\n","Assume for simplicity that there are no existing generators -- that is, this is a \"greenfield\" expansion problem where all generators are newly built.\n","\n","Finally, assume that any involuntary curtailment of demand caused by shortfalls in supply is penalized at the cost of non-served energy (NSE).
