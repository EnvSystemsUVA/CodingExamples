Davidson to use Python instead of Julia. The original notebook can be found here: https://github.com/Power-Systems-Optimization-Course/power-systems-optimization/blob/master/Notebooks/05-Unit-Commitment.ipynb.\n","\n","This notebook will illustrate how to optimize the economic dispatch of power generators while accounting for binary startup (called \"commitment\") decisions, constraints, and costs of thermal generators. The goal is to minimize the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand, subject to the constraints of operating systems with large amounts of (inflexible) thermal generation. Accounting for these commitment (binary variable) constraints requires significant computational trade-offs.\n","\n","*****\n","\n","We build up the model in several stages. We first start with the simplest model that incorporates unit commitment decisions in order to understand the logic of three-variable commitment formulations.\n","\n","Next, we introduce moderate complexity through the addition of ramp constraints to account for startups and shutdowns.\n","\n","Finally, we model a more realistic unit commitment that includes reserves&mdash;an important feature of day-ahead scheduling in power systems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zhmxpL_Xvshe"},"source":["## Introduction to unit commitment\n","\n","Engineering considerations severely limit the possible output ranges of power plants. System operators need to be aware of these limitations when scheduling generation to meet demand. Thermal power plants, in particular, due to their complex designs, thermodynamic cycles, and material properties, can be particularly challenging. In practice, due to the times involved in bringing these power plants online, much of this scheduling is done day-ahead, which gives rise to the need for a day-ahead market.\n","\n","**Unit commitment economic dispatch** (UCED) is the problem of minimizing short-run costs of production inclusive of production and startup costs, in order to meet a given demand and considering relevant engineering constraints of the generators.
