Plotting\n","\n","Programming is extremely useful for visualizing data. Matplotlib is the main library for plotting. Check this link for examples of how to make different types of plots: https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html. Below, I'll simply show how to make line plots with multiple subplots and different axes scales (linear vs. log).\n","\n","Some other helpful resources for determining colors are:\n","Matplotlib colors: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html  \n","Matplotlib colormaps: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html  \n","Colorbrewer for determining what types of colormaps to use for sequential, diverging, or categorical/qualitative data that is print friendly, color-blind safe and/or photocopy safe: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3"],"metadata":{"id":"_D8ur3HWMbXB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","\n","x = np.arange(0,100,5)\n","y = 3*x - 2*x**2\n","z = 2*x + 5*x**2\n","\n","fig = plt.figure() # create figure\n","\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(2,1,1) # add axis in 1st position of figure with 2 rows, 1 column\n","ax.plot(x, y, c=\"tab:blue\")\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")\n","ax2 = ax.twinx() # create new axis called ax2 that uses same x axis as ax\n","ax2.plot(x, z, c=\"tab:red\")\n","ax2.set_ylabel(\"z\") # label on opposite y axis\n","\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(2,1,2) # add axis in 2nd position of figure with 2 rows, 1 column\n","ax.plot(y, z, c = \"tab:blue\")\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"y\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"z\")\n","ax2 = ax.twiny() # create new axis called ax2 that uses same y axis as ax\n","ax2.plot(x, z, c = \"tab:red\")\n","ax2.set_xlabel(\"x\") # label on opposite x axis\n","\n","fig.tight_layout() # adjust plots so no labels overlap\n","\n","# figure numbering is across columns starting at 1, then moving to the next row\n","# so a 3 x 2 figure is numbered\n","# 1, 2\n","# 3, 4\n","# 5, 6"],"metadata":{"id":"h9hPt4SzWcSU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2) # create figure with 2 rows and 2 column\n","\n","ax[0,0].plot(x, y, c=\"tab:blue\") # subplot in first row and first column\n","ax[0,0].set_ylabel(\"y\")\n","ax[0,1].plot(z, y, c=\"tab:red\") # subplot in first row and second column\n","ax[1,0].plot(x, z, c=\"tab:green\") # subplot in second row and first column\n","ax[1,0].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax[1,0].set_ylabel(\"z\")\n","ax[1,1].plot(z, z, c=\"tab:orange\") # subplot in second row and second column\n","ax[1,1].set_xlabel(\"z\")\n","\n","fig.tight_layout() # adjust plots so no labels overlap"],"metadata":{"id":"vnQZZaCsc3Zx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# same figure as above but share x axes within columns and y axes within rows\n","\n","fig = plt.figure()\n","gs = fig.add_gridspec(2, 2, hspace=0, wspace=0)\n","(ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4) = gs.subplots(sharex='col', sharey='row')\n","fig.suptitle('Sharing x per column, y per row')\n","ax1.plot(x, y, c=\"tab:blue\")\n","ax2.plot(z, y, c=\"tab:red\")\n","ax3.plot(x, z, c=\"tab:green\")\n","ax4.plot(z, z, c=\"tab:orange\")\n","\n","for ax in fig.get_axes():\n","    ax.label_outer() # only label outer axes"],"metadata":{"id":"O-b0SgQ2fku1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# make x axis log-scale\n","y = x**2\n","\n","fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n","ax.semilogy(x,y)\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")"],"metadata":{"id":"uj90abPlfJIX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# make y axis log-scale\n","y = np.sqrt(x)\n","\n","fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n","ax.semilogx(x,y)\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")"],"metadata":{"id":"Cv7RqLB0hTcv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# make both axes log-scale\n","fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n","ax.loglog(x,y)\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")"],"metadata":{"id":"7VlLJymvhmLr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
